# The projects I created when studying at [RS School](https://rs.school/) - JS/Frontend course
*The projects have been created and optimized for the Google Chrome browser.*

- Pet shelter webpage

[view project's page](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/shevelevbv-JSFE2022Q1/shelter/pages/main/)

The project is a webpage of a pet shelter where a potential owner may select their own new friend. The project has been created using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. JavaScript is used for the caroussel and pagination for browsing through the available pets' cards. The pages feature the responsive design (created with the desktop-first approach).

- News portal

Using News API provided by newsapi.org, I created an app delivering news based on the reader's language preferences.

**Disclaimer:** the API key may have expired, so the functionality of the app may be limited.

- Online store

[view project's page](https://shevelevbv.github.io/RSS_Projects/online-store/)

The project is a single-page application of a tea store written entirely in TypeScript (no frameworks used). The content updates dynamically via DOM API. 
The architecture of the webpage is based on the MVC pattern, and all logical components are split in classes.

The cards of the products are displayed depending on multiple filtering criteria: the search result, ranges, and selections. The results can also be sorted 
differently. The cart gets updated when the customer clicks on a card. 

- Async race

[view project's page](https://shevelevbv.github.io/RSS_Projects/async-race/)

The project presents a single-page application (SPA) written in TypeScript with the use of REST API.
The user can click a button to start a race. When the race is complete, the results get recorded in a table on a separate page.

The code includes abundant asynchronous functions.

**Disclaimer:** to run the application, first, the user has to run a local web server with the Async Race API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).
